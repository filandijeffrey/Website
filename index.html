        <p>Suzanne Collins is the author of the worldwide bestselling series The Hunger Games.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In 1991, Suzanne Collins began her professional career writing for children's television. She worked on the staffs of several Nickelodeon shows, including the Emmy-nominated hit <b><em>Clarissa Explains it All</em></b> and <b><em>The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo.</em></b> For preschool viewers, she penned multiple stories for the Emmy-nominated <b><em>Little Bear and Oswald.</em></b> She also co-wrote the Rankin/Bass Christmas special, <b><em>Santa, Baby!</em></b> with her friend, Peter Bakalian, which was nominated for a WGA Award in Animation. Most recently she was the Head Writer for Scholastic Entertainment's <b><em>Clifford's Puppy Days</em></b> and a freelancer on <b><em>Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!</em></b> While working on a Kids WB show called <b><em>Generation O!</em></b> she met children's author and illustrator James Proimos, who talked her into giving children's books a try.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Thinking one day about Alice in Wonderland, she was struck by how pastoral the setting must seem to kids who, like her own, lived in urban surroundings. In New York City, you're much more likely to fall down a manhole than a rabbit hole and, if you do, you're not going to find a tea party. What you might find...? Well, that's the story of Gregor the Overlander, the first book in her five-part fantasy war series, The Underland Chronicles, which became a New York Times bestseller. It has been sold into 21 foreign territories. Audio books in English are read by Paul Boehmer and the final one was chosen as a 2009 ALSC Notable Children's Recording. </P>
		<br>
		<p>Her next series, The Hunger Games, is a dystopian war story composed of five books, including the initial trilogy of The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay, and two prequels, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes and Sunrise on the Reaping. It's spent over six years to date on The New York Times bestseller list since publication in September 2008, and has also appeared consistently on USA Today and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists. An international bestseller, it has been sold into 54 territories in 52 languages. October 1, 2024, saw the publication of the first book in the illustrated series with art by Nico Delort. Recent audio books in English are read by Tatiana Maslany (The Hunger Games Trilogy), Santino Fontana (The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes), and Jefferson White (Sunrise on the Reaping.)</P>
		<br>

                <h3>THE HUNGER GAMES</h3>
				<p>Katniss is a 16-year-old girl living with her mother and younger sister in the poorest district of Panem, the remains of what used be North America. Long ago the districts waged war on the Capitol and were defeated. As part of the surrender terms, each district agreed to send one boy and one girl to appear in an annual televised event called, "The Hunger Games." The terrain, rules, and level of audience participation may change but one thing is constant: kill or be killed. When her sister is chosen by lottery, Katniss steps up to go in her place.

				<p>Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying. (Scholastic Press, 2009)</p>
